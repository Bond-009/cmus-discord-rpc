[![travis-ci Build Status][travis-ci-badge]][travis-ci-page] [![Discord][discord-badge]][discord-invite]

Discord Rich Presence integration for the C* Music Player (`cmus`).

## Installing

- If it isn't already on your system, install `rust`, and `cargo`. On \*nix based systems this should be as simple as installing it from your package manager.

- Obtain the sources. You can either do this by cloning the repository using `git` or downloading an archive of the repository.    
      
  Cloning using HTTPS:      
      
      git clone https://github.com/Bond-009/cmus-discord-rpc 
      
  Cloning using `ssh`:

      git clone git@github.com:Bond-009/cmus-discord-rpc.git

  Downloading an archive using `wget`:

       wget https://github.com/Bond-009/cmus-discord-rpc/archive/master.zip

       unzip master.zip

- Change your directory into where the sources were cloned/extracted to.

      cd cmus-discord-rpc

- Next, build and install it to your home directory.
    
      cargo install --path .

- Once `cargo`'s installation directory is in your `PATH` (`cargo` should tell you where the end of the previous step) simply run `cmus-discord-rpc` and it should start!

## Building

- Obtain the sources. You can either do this by cloning the repository or downloading an archive of the repository.

- Change your directory into where the sources were cloned/extracted to.

- Finally to build, use the following commands:
  
  For debugging:
        
      cargo build

  For production use:
      
      cargo build --release

- You should see a new directory called `target`. There you can find subfolders for each of your build targets.
