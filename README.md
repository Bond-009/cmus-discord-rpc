Discord Rich Presence integration for the C* Music Player (`cmus`).

## Installing

- If it isn't already on your system, install `rust`, and `cargo`. On \*nix based systems this should be as simple as installing it from your package manager.

- Clone the repository.

- Change your directory into the cloned repository.

- Run `cargo install --path .`. This will install it to a directory in your home/user folder.

## Building

- Clone the repository.

- Run `cargo build`.

- You should see a directory called `target` be created. You can find your built binaries there.
